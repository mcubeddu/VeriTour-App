# VeriTour-App
VeriTour is an iOS app developed for a final project in Harvard's CS50.

For our final project in CS50, after only coding for three to four months, 
Will Finigan, Nate Hollenberg, and I created this iOS app in just 3 weeks.
The goal of the app was to serve as a virtual tour guide for tourists
visiting Harvard's campus. It tracks the user's location (with permission)
and uses geofencing and the AppleMaps API to present the user with the two
nearest points of interest on campus, in real time. The user can interact with
these POIs by clicking on them, seeing an image, and reading a description of the
location. Note: this app hasn't been updated for new versions of iOS and Swift (yet).
